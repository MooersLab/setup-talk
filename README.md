# setup-manuscript
Script for creating common subfolders in a folder for a manuscript on my local computer. 
The script also writes a AAAreadme.md file with a description of the role of each subfolders.

I was getting tired of having hetergeneous subfolder structures for different research papers, so I wrote this script.
I am sharing this script because it might inspire others to follow a similar approach and had to get it under version control anyways.

My orkflow involves writing the manuscript in LaTeX on Overleaf.
I have additional subfolders on Overleaf.
The project on Overleaf is under version control in the `ov` folder.
