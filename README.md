# Setup for a talk
Script for creating common subfolders in a folder for a talk on my local computer. 
The script also writes a AAAreadme.md file with a description of the role of each subfolder.

I was tired of heterogeneous subfolder structures for different talks, so I wrote this script.
I am sharing this script because it might inspire others to follow a similar approach.
I had to get it under version control anyway.

My workflow involves writing the talk in LaTeX on Overleaf.
I have additional subfolders on Overleaf.
The project on Overleaf is under version control in the `overleaf` folder.
